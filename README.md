🔐 Project 02: Password Strength Meter
📌 Objective
Build a Password Strength Meter in Python that evaluates a user's password based on security rules. The program will:

Analyze passwords based on length, character types, and patterns.
Assign a strength score (Weak, Moderate, Strong).
Provide feedback to improve weak passwords.
Use control flow, type casting, strings, and functions.
🔹 Requirements
1. Password Strength Criteria
A strong password should:
✅ Be at least 8 characters long
✅ Contain uppercase & lowercase letters
✅ Include at least one digit (0-9)
✅ Have one special character (!@#$%^&*)

2. Scoring System
Weak (Score: 1-2) → Short, missing key elements
Moderate (Score: 3-4) → Good but missing some security features
Strong (Score: 5) → Meets all criteria
3. Feedback System
If the password is weak, suggest improvements.
If the password is strong, display a success message.
